\frametitle{Module Objective}

In this module we will use non-blocking assignments to model sequential design behaviour.
\newline

\textbf{Topics:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Blocking assignment introduction
\item Blocking assignments in sequential procedures
\item Non-blocking assignment introduction
\item Non-blocking assignments in sequential procedures
\item Assignments in combinational procedures
\item Mixing blocking and non-blocking assignments
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}
\note{
Out objective is to correctly choose between blocking and non-blocking assignments. To do that, we need to know more details about using blocking and non-blocking assignments in combinational and sequential procedures.
